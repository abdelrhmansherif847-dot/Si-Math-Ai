# Phase B — Critical Security & Authorization

Goal: secure the data layer before building any adaptive logic on top of it.
Everything here is derived from the Supabase **security advisor** against
project `igvkyxkmjnkzscqgommj`, cross-checked against real call sites.

**Advisor delta (2026-07-21, final):** `rls_disabled_in_public` **6 → 0** (all
ERRORs cleared); `anon_security_definer_function_executable` **19 → 0** (fully
cleared); `function_search_path_mutable` **12 → 0** (fully cleared). Residual:
15 `authenticated_security_definer_function_executable` (by design — see
AUTHZ-01), 7 `rls_enabled_no_policy` INFO (2 = SEC-01 secure-in-place; 5
pre-existing/out-of-scope, default-deny), and `auth_leaked_password_protection`
until AUTH-01 is toggled.

### AUTHZ-01b review evidence (before apply)

`consume_credits` touches live credit balances, so it was reviewed
independently before applying:

- **Body integrity:** `md5(deployed_body)` = `md5(migration_body)` =
  `b8ddc1a5063663fd0ab99e593dae94db`; `md5(body − guard)` = `md5(prior live
  body)` = `ad3ecb85…d8a28f`. The guard block is the *only* change; no
  credit/accounting logic altered. Verified again in-transaction via an MD5
  self-guard that would have rolled the apply back on any byte drift.
- **Behavioral battery** (rolled-back tx, synthetic users): paid consume,
  repeat, insufficient, cross-user block (`forbidden_user_mismatch` with victim
  balance untouched), refund round-trip, FREE daily-limit path, admin bypass,
  and service_role-acts-for-any-user — all passed.
- **Guard semantics:** end user (JWT) may spend only their own credits;
  `service_role` (auth.uid() NULL) may act for any user. `chat.html` always
  passes `currentUser.id` (= `auth.uid()`), so no client flow is blocked.

## SEC-01 — MIG-B1 leftover tables

`mig_b1_map` (69) and `weakness_signals_bak_mig_b1_20260702` (476) are
unreferenced leftovers from the completed 2026-07-02 backfill. The backup holds
real user weakness data readable by anon (RLS off → ERROR).

- **Secure-in-place** (committed default): enable RLS, no policy → default-deny.
  Reversible, no data loss; downgrades the lint to INFO (`rls_enabled_no_policy`).
- **Drop** (recommended cleanup): removes the exposed data at rest and clears
  the lint entirely. Irreversible → needs explicit approval.

## SEC-02 — `analyzer_runs`

PII-free per-user telemetry. The **frozen** `regenerate-reports.js` inserts the
current user's own row client-side, so RLS keeps: `INSERT` where
`user_id = auth.uid()` (or admin), `SELECT` for admins only. `service_role`
bypasses RLS for retention.

## SEC-03 / SEC-04 — taxonomy registry & `plan_definitions`

Reference/catalog tables, no user data. Matched to the existing reference-table
pattern (`credit_costs` / `credit_packs` / `pricing_settings`): **public read,
admin write**. The SECURITY DEFINER functions that read them
(`approve_payment_request`, `log_unmapped_detection`) bypass RLS and are
unaffected.

## SEC-05 — mutable `search_path`

12 functions had no pinned `search_path` (privilege-escalation vector on
definer functions). Pinned to `public` via `ALTER FUNCTION` — matches the
convention already used by the other ~13 definer functions; bodies unchanged.

## AUTHZ-01 — dual authorization model

Every `SECURITY DEFINER` function ran with PUBLIC EXECUTE and/or an explicit
`anon` grant. Enforcement is now applied at **two layers**:

1. **Grant layer** (`…authz01a`): revoke `PUBLIC` + `anon` from every definer
   function; grant EXECUTE only to the role(s) that legitimately call it.
2. **In-body layer** (`…authz01b`): `consume_credits` gained an owner-identity
   guard — an end user (JWT present) may spend only their own credits;
   `service_role` (auth.uid() NULL) may act for anyone.

Grant matrix (verified against call sites):

| Function(s) | anon | authenticated | service_role | Why |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| `activate_subscription`, `activate_credit_pack`, `activate_pro_subscription`, `claim_founder_slot` | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | legacy/unused; superseded by `approve_payment_request` |
| `handle_new_user` | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | trigger-only (EXECUTE not checked when a trigger fires) |
| `consume_credits`, `refund_ai_credit`, `award_focus_xp`, `delete_my_account`, `enforce_my_subscription_expiry`, `can_register_device` | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | client self-service; in-body `auth.uid()` guard |
| `change_user_role`, `approve_payment_request`, `reject_payment_request` | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | admin.html; in-body admin/owner check |
| `get_zero_personality`, `search_zero_knowledge` | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | Edge Function (service_role); read-only |
| `auth_is_admin`, `current_user_role`, `has_role_at_least` | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | RLS predicates; reveal only caller's own role |
| `log_unmapped_detection` | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | already correct; re-asserted |

**Expected residual advisor state (by design, not a gap):**
`anon_security_definer_function_executable` → **0**.
`authenticated_security_definer_function_executable` remains for the functions
authenticated is *designed* to call — each protected by an in-body identity/role
check. That is the intended dual model.

## AUTH-01 — Leaked password protection (BLOCKED: requires Pro plan)

**Investigated 2026-07-21.** This cannot be enabled on the current plan.

- Supabase docs: *"Leaked password protection is available on the Pro Plan and
  above."* The org `yqmkfwkdoslxmxzsykao` is on the **Free** plan
  (`get_organization` → `"plan":"free"`), so the toggle is gated.
- The dashboard's **Authentication → Attack Protection → "Prevent use of leaked
  passwords"** shows **"Configure in email provider"** because the setting
  lives on the Email auth-provider page
  (`/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers?provider=Email`). That wording is a
  redirect to where the control lives — it is **NOT** a request to configure a
  custom email/SMTP service. This project already uses the Email provider
  (100% of identities are `provider=email`, 19/19).
- Therefore this is a **plan gate**, not a misconfiguration or a missing email
  provider. The `auth_leaked_password_protection` advisor WARN **cannot be
  cleared while on Free**.

**To enable natively:** upgrade org → **Pro**, then Authentication → Sign In /
Providers → **Email** → enable "Prevent use of leaked passwords". No SMTP setup
needed. (Pro also removes Free-tier inactivity pausing + adds daily backups.)

**Free-plan mitigations (recommended regardless):**
1. Set a strong password policy (min length + required character classes) on the
   same Email provider page — available on Free.
2. Optional: DIY client-side HIBP k-anonymity check in `signup.html` /
   `reset-password.html` (send only the 5-char SHA-1 prefix to the HIBP range
   API). Not server-enforced, but covers the common case.

## Out of Phase B scope (observed, not addressed here)

`rls_enabled_no_policy` (INFO) on `goal_history`, `resources`,
`study_consistency`, `unmapped_detections`, `users` — RLS is ON so these are
default-deny (not an exposure). Flagged for a later pass, not part of Phase B.

## Apply order & workflow

Per `CLAUDE.md`, each migration is applied only after explicit approval, then
verified with the security advisor. Migrations are self-contained DDL with no
dependent code shipping, so there is no migration/code ordering race
(`scripts/check-migration-parity.sh` stays green — no new columns).
